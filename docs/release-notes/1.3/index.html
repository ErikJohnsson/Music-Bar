	<h3>ðŸŽ† Happy New Year!</h3>
	<p>v1.3: Music Bar's <strong>last</strong> update of 2019.</p>

	<p>I hope you are still enjoying Music Bar. I definitely still enjoy working on these updates, and hope to continue doing so in 2020. Quite a lot of work goes into maintaining this app, so if you can, please <a href="https://www.paypal.me/musa11971" target="_blank">donate</a>. Every little bit helps and it motivates me to make more cool stuff! ðŸ’œ</p>

	<p>Out with the old, in with the new: may you be happy the whole year through! Now for the release notes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Added support for localization</strong> <br />
			Music Bar can now be localized, which basically means it has built-in support for many different languages. <br />
			For now, the app supports:
			<ul>
				<li>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English</li>
				<li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Dutch</li>
				<li>ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German</li>
			</ul>
			If your language is not listed above and you want to help, please <a href="https://github.com/musa11971/Music-Bar" target="_blank">contribute on GitHub</a>. Or you can instead just email me and we can work something out: <a href="mailto:mussesemou99@gmail.com">mussesemou99@gmail.com</a>.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Small layout fixes</strong> <br />
			Fixed some layout related stuff, so that everything looks ok in other languages too.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Changed idle behavior</strong> <br />
			The app now shows an icon in the Menu Bar when no music is playing, instead of just saying "Music Bar".
		</li>
		<li><strong>Other small code improvements and clean-ups.</strong></li>
	</ul>
