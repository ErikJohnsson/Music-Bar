	<ul>
		<li><strong>Added an all new playback slider</strong> <br>
			The new playback slider adapts its color to the artwork of the current song.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Added new app icons</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Added asynchronous artwork image downloading</strong> <br>
			This makes for a much smoother user experience. You may have experienced that the application would hang previously. This should no longer happen.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Added an option to automatically switch dark/light mode</strong> <br>
			This new option under "Preferences -&gt; Display" will make the application automatically adapt to the system's appearance.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Fixed a layout issue where the playback slider was cut off slightly</strong></li>
